                    <p>
                        We were born as a YouTube channel about racing
                        games, like Forza Horizon 4, but we're
                        constantly evolving to much more than
                        that. You can find videos on how to
                        make a lot of money in FH4, guides for
                        tuning, driving tips and even
                        long format episodes with a story background. 
                        Welcome to this community and
                        if you want to access the channel,<a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCacRuG098TWXAXjkJLOTFKw'> click here.</a>

                        This website aims to support the Racing Legends channel on Youtube.
                        The main content of the site as of 2021 are the car price charts
                        of Forza Horizon 4 auctions. These charts are very similar to those
                        widely used by stock exchange investors to check
                        share prices.
                        </br></br>
                        With them, you can track car prices and, knowing when they are
                        expensive and when they are cheap, you can buy or sell units to have
                        profits or get a good car for a low price!
                        </br></br>
                        If you want to learn more about it, watch the video on the auction prices
                        page. I hope you enjoy the experience! :)
